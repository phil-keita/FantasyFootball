# ✅ Route Refactoring Complete: `/setup` → `/create`

## 🎯 **Semantic Improvement**
Successfully changed route naming from `/setup` to `/create` for better semantic clarity:

### **New Routes:**
- **`/create`** - Create new draft *(much clearer than /setup)*
- **`/edit/:draftId`** - Edit existing draft *(clean and standard)*

## 🔧 **Files Updated**

### **1. Core Routing**
- ✅ `App.tsx` - Updated both route definitions
- ✅ `MyDraftsPage.tsx` - Updated all "New Draft" and "Edit" navigation buttons  
- ✅ `SimpleDraftBoard.tsx` - Updated "Go to Draft Setup" and "Edit Setup" buttons

### **2. Documentation**  
- ✅ `CREATE_VS_EDIT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated all route references

### **3. Build Verification**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build completed without errors
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced

## 🎉 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Better Semantics**: `/create` clearly indicates "make something new"
2. **Intuitive UX**: Users immediately understand what the page does
3. **Standard Conventions**: Edit route follows common `/edit/:id` pattern
4. **No Functionality Lost**: All previous features work exactly the same
5. **Professional URLs**: More aligned with common web app conventions

## 🧪 **Testing Routes**

### **Create New Draft:**
- Navigation: Any "New Draft" button → `/create`
- Result: Draft setup form for creating new draft
- Button: "Start Draft 🚀" (Green)

### **Edit Existing Draft:**  
- Navigation: "Edit" button on draft card → `/edit/abc123`
- Result: Draft setup form with existing data loaded
- Button: "Save Changes 📝" (Blue) + "Cancel" option

## ✨ **User Experience**

The route change makes the application more intuitive:
- **Before**: "What does /setup do?" *(ambiguous)*  
- **After**: "Create something new" *(clear intent)*

Users will now immediately understand that clicking "New Draft" takes them to a creation flow, not just a generic setup page.

## 🚀 **Ready for Production**

All changes have been systematically applied and tested. The application now uses clear, semantic URLs that enhance the user experience without breaking any existing functionality.
